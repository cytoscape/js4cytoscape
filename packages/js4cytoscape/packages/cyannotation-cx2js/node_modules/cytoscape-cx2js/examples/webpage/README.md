A simple example of using the bundle.js file in conjunction with HTML to parse cx into a Cytoscape.js driven web page.

This needs to be accessible via http or https to work.

If you have python 3, you can do the following in the root of the cx2js project:

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

You can also use a static web server app, such as [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en), run on the root of the cx2js project.

With either of these methods, you can access the following url to run the example:

```
http://localhost/examples/webpage/
```
